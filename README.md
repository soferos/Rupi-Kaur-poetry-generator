# Rupi-Kaur-poetry-generator
my amateur attempt at learning NLP, altogether created using a small sample consisiting of all poems by Rupi Kaur 
from her books Sun and Her Flowers and Milk and Honey. The reason why I chose this poet is because her poetry is often 
not considered poetry at all by some critics as many poems just resemble simple sentences broken down into a number of lines.
I wanted to see how a deep learning model will adapt to that compensating for the small sample size.
It would definitely be better if the sample was bigger as low temperatures produce similar poems and higher temperatures 
sometimes produce non-words. Contained within are the text file it was trained on, saved model (in the Rupi Kaur) folder and code.
