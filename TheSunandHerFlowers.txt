how is it so easy for you
to be kind to people he asked

milk and honey dripped 
from my lips as i answered

cause people have not 
been kind to me


the first boy that kissed me 
held my shoulders down 
like the handlebars of
the first bicycle 
he ever rode
i was five

he had the smell of 
starvation on his lips 
which he picked up from
his father feasting on his mother at 4 a.m.

he was the first boy
to teach me my body was
for giving to those that wanted 
that i should feel anything
less than whole

and my god
did i feel as empty
as his mother at 4:25 a.m.


 


it is your blood 
in my veins
tell me how i’m 
supposed to forget


the therapist places 
the doll in front of you 
it is the size of girls
your uncles like touching

point to where his hands were

you point to the spot 
between its legs the one 
he fingered out of you 
like a confession

how’re you feeling

you pull the lump 
in your throat out 
with your teeth 
and say fine 
numb really

-	midweek sessions



he was supposed to be
the first male love of your life 
you still search for him 
everywhere

-	father


you were so afraid 
of my voice
i decided to be 
afraid of it too



she was a rose
in the hands of those 
who had no intention 
of keeping her


every time you 
tell your daughter 
you yell at her 
out of love
you teach her to confuse 
anger with kindness
which seems like a good idea 
till she grows up to
trust men who hurt her 
cause they look so much 
like you

-	to fathers with daughters




i’ve had sex she said 
but i don’t know 
what making love 
feels like


if i knew what 
safety looked like 
i would have spent
less time falling into 
arms that were not



sex takes the consent of two
if one person is lying there not doing anything 
cause they are not ready
or not in the mood
or simply don’t want to 
yet the other is having sex
with their body it’s not love 
it is rape


the idea that we are 
so capable of love 
but still choose
to be toxic



there is no bigger illusion in the world 
than the idea that a woman will
bring dishonor into a home 
if she tries to keep her heart 
and her body safe


you pinned 
my legs to 
the ground 
with your feet
and demanded 
i stand up



the rape will 
tear you
in half

but it 
will not 
end you


you have sadness 
living in places 
sadness shouldn’t live



a daughter should 
not have to
beg her father 
for a relationship


 

trying to convince myself 
i am allowed
to take up space
is like writing with 
my left hand
when i was born 
to use my right

-	the idea of shrinking is hereditary


you tell me to quiet down cause
my opinions make me less beautiful
but i was not made with a fire in my belly 
so i could be put out
i was not made with a lightness on my tongue 
so i could be easy to swallow
i was made heavy
half blade and half silk 
difficult to forget and not easy 
for the mind to follow


he guts her 
with his fingers
like he’s scraping 
the inside of a 
cantaloupe clean




your mother
is in the habit of 
offering more love 
than you can carry
your father is absent 
you are a war
the border between two countries
the collateral damage
the paradox that joins the two 
but also splits them apart


emptying out of my mother’s belly 
was my first act of disappearance 
learning to shrink for a family
who likes their daughters invisible 
was the second
the art of being empty 
is simple
believe them when they say 
you are nothing
repeat it to yourself 
like a wish
i am nothing 
i am nothing 
i am nothing 
so often
the only reason you know 
you’re still alive is from the 
heaving of your chest

-	the art of being empty



you look just like your mother

      i guess i do carry her tenderness well 
you both have the same eyes
      cause we are both exhausted 
and the hands
we share the same wilting fingers
but that rage your mother doesn’t wear that anger 
you’re right
this rage is the one thing 
i get from my father




(homage to warsan shire’s inheritance)


when my mother opens her mouth 
to have a conversation at dinner 
my father shoves the word hush 
between her lips and tells her to 
never speak with her mouth full
this is how the women in my family 
learned to live with their mouths closed



our knees 
pried open 
by cousins 
and uncles 
and men
our bodies touched
by all the wrong people
that even in a bed full of safety 
we are afraid


father. you always call to say nothing in particular. you ask what i’m doing or where i am and 
when the silence stretches like a lifetime between us i scramble to find questions to keep the 
conversation going. what i long to say most is. i understand this world broke you. it has been so 
hard on your feet. i don’t blame you for not knowing how to remain soft with me. sometimes i 
stay up thinking of all the places you are hurting which you’ll never care to mention. i come from 
the same aching blood. from the same bone so desperate for attention i collapse in on myself. i 
am your daughter. i know the small talk is the only way you know how to tell me you love me. 
cause it is the only way i know how to tell you.




you plough into me with two fingers and i am mostly shocked. it feels like rubber against an open 
wound. i do not like it. you begin pushing faster and faster. but i feel nothing. you search my face 
for a reaction so i begin acting like the naked women in the videos you watch when you think no 
one’s looking. i imitate their moans. hollow and hungry. you ask if it feels good and i say yes so 
quickly it sounds rehearsed. but the acting. you do not notice.








 


i can’t tell if my mother is 
terrified or in love with 
my father it all
looks the same


i flinch when you touch me 
i fear it is him



 


when my mother was pregnant 
with her second child i was four
i pointed at her swollen belly confused at how 
my mother had gotten so big in such little time 
my father scooped me in his tree trunk arms and 
said the closest thing to god on this earth
is a woman’s body it’s where life comes from 
and to have a grown man tell me something 
so powerful at such a young age
changed me to see the entire universe 
rested at my mother’s feet




i struggle so deeply 
to understand
how someone can 
pour their entire soul 
blood and energy 
into someone 
without wanting 
anything in
return

-	i will have to wait till i’m a mother


 

no
it won’t 
be love at
first sight when
we meet it’ll be love
at first remembrance cause
i’ve seen you in my mother’s eyes 
when she tells me to marry the type
of man i’d want to raise my son to be like


every revolution 
starts and ends 
with his lips


what am i to you he asks 
i put my hands in his lap 
and whisper you
are every hope 
i’ve ever had 
in human form




my favorite thing about you is your smell 
you smell like
earth 
herbs 
gardens
a little more
human than the rest of us


i know i
should crumble 
for better reasons 
but have you seen 
that boy he brings 
the sun to its 
knees every
night




you are the faint line 
between faith and 
blindly waiting

-	letter to my future lover


nothing is safer
than the sound of you 
reading out loud to me

-	the perfect date




he placed his hands 
on my mind
before reaching 
for my waist 
my hips
or my lips
he didn’t call me 
beautiful first
he called me 
exquisite

-	how he touches me


i am learning 
how to love him 
by loving myself




he says
i am sorry i am not an easy person to want
i look at him surprised 
who said i wanted easy 
i don’t crave easy
i crave goddamn difficult


the very thought of you 
has my legs spread apart 
like an easel with a canvas 
begging for art



i am ready for you 
i have always 
been
ready for you

-	the first time


i do not want to have you
to fill the empty parts of me 
i want to be full on my own 
i want to be so complete
i could light a whole city 
and then
i want to have you
cause the two of us combined 
could set it on fire



love will come
and when love comes 
love will hold you
love will call your name 
and you will melt 
sometimes though
love will hurt you but 
love will never mean to 
love will play no games 
cause love knows life
has been hard enough already


i’d be lying if i said
you make me speechless 
the truth is you make my 
tongue so weak it forgets 
what language to speak in




he asks me what i do
i tell him i work for a small company 
that makes packaging for—
he stops me midsentence
no not what you do to pay the bills 
what drives you crazy
what keeps you up at night

i tell him i write
he asks me to show him something 
i take the tips of my fingers
place them inside his forearm 
and graze them down his wrist 
goose bumps rise to the surface 
i see his mouth clench
muscles tighten
his eyes pore into mine 
as though i’m the reason 
for making them blink
i break gaze just as 
he inches toward me 
i step back

so that’s what you do 
you command attention 
my cheeks flush as
i smile shyly 
confessing
i can’t help it


you might not have been my first love 
but you were the love that made
all the other loves 
irrelevant





you’ve touched me 
without even 
touching me


how do you turn
a forest fire like me 
so soft i turn into 
running water




you look like you smell of 
honey and no pain
let me have a taste of that


your name is 
the strongest
positive and negative 
connotation in any language 
it either lights me up or 
leaves me aching for days




you talk too much
he whispers into my ear
i can think of better ways to use that mouth


it’s your voice 
that undresses me




my name sounds so good 
french kissing your tongue


you wrap your fingers 
around my hair
and pull 
this
is how you make 
music out of me

-	foreplay




on days 
like this
i need you to 
run your fingers 
through my hair 
and speak softly

-	you


i want your hands 
to hold
not my hands 
your lips
to kiss
not my lips
but other places


 


i need someone 
who knows struggle 
as well as i do 
someone
willing to hold my feet in their lap 
on days it is too difficult to stand 
the type of person who gives 
exactly what i need
before i even know i need it 
the type of lover who hears me 
even when i do not speak
is the type of understanding 
i demand

-	the type of lover i need


you move my hand 
between my legs 
and whisper
make those pretty little fingers dance for me

-	solo performance




we’ve been arguing more than we ought to. about things neither of us remember or care about 
cause that’s how we avoid the bigger questions. instead of asking why we don’t say i love you to 
one another as often as we used to. we fight about things like: who was supposed to get up and 
turn the lights off first. or who was supposed to pop the frozen pizza in the oven after work. 
taking hits at the most vulnerable parts of one another. we’re like fingers on thorns honey. we 
know exactly where it hurts.

and everything is on the table tonight. like that one time you whispered a name i’m pretty sure 
wasn’t mine in your sleep. or last week when you said you were working late. so i called work but 
they said you’d already left a couple hours ago. where were you for those couple hours.

i know. i know. your excuses make all the sense in the world. and i get a little carried away for no 
good reason and eventually begin crying. but what else do you expect baby. i love you so much. 
i’m sorry i thought you were lying.

that’s when you hold your head with your hands in frustration. half begging me to stop. half tired 
and sick of it. the toxin in our mouths has burnt holes in our cheeks. we look less alive than we 
used to. less color in our faces. but don’t kid yourself. no matter how bad it gets we both know 
you still wanna nail me to the ground.

especially when i’m screaming so loud our fighting wakes the neighbors. and they come running 
to the door to save us. baby don’t open it.

instead. lie me down. lay me open like a map. and with your finger trace the places you still want 
to **** out of me. kiss me like i am the center point of gravity and you are falling into me like 
my soul is the focal point of yours. and when your mouth is kissing not my mouth but other 
places. my legs will split apart out of habit. and that’s when. i pull you in. welcome you. home.

when the entire street is looking out their windows wondering what all the commotion is. and the 
fire trucks come rolling in to save us but they can’t distinguish whether these flames began with 
our anger or our passion. i will smile. throw my head back. arch my body like a mountain you 
want to split in half. baby lick me.

like your mouth has the gift of reading and i’m your favorite book. find your favorite page in the 
soft spot between my legs and read it carefully. fluently. vividly. don’t you dare leave a single 
word untouched. and i swear my ending will be so good. the last few words will come. running to 
your mouth. and when you’re done. take a seat. cause it’s my turn to make music with my knees 
pressed to the ground.

sweet baby. this. is how we pull language out of one another with the flick of our tongues. this is 
how we have the conversation. this. is how we make up.

-	how we make up


 


 


when my mother says i deserve better 
i snap to your defense out of habit
he still loves me i shout
she looks at me with defeated eyes 
the way a parent looks at their child
when they know this is the type of pain 
even they can’t fix
and says
it means nothing to me if he loves you
if he can’t do a single wretched thing about it


you were so distant
i forgot you were there at all



you said. if it is meant to be. fate will bring us back together. for a second i wonder if you are 
really that naive. if you really believe fate works like that. as if it lives in the sky staring down at 
us. as if it has five fingers and spends its time placing us like pieces of chess. as if it is not the 
choices we make. who taught you that. tell me. who convinced you. you’ve been given a heart and 
a mind that isn’t yours to use. that your actions do not define what will become of you. i want to 
scream and shout it’s us you fool. we’re the only ones that can bring us back together. but instead 
i sit quietly. smiling softly through quivering lips thinking. isn’t it such a tragic thing. when you 
can see it so clearly but the other person doesn’t.


don’t mistake 
salt for sugar 
if he wants to 
be with you 
he will
it’s that simple




he only whispers i love you
as he slips his hands 
down the waistband 
of your pants

this is where you must 
understand the difference 
between want and need 
you may want that boy 
but you certainly
don’t need him


you were temptingly beautiful 
but stung when i got close




the woman who comes after me will be a bootleg version of who i am. she will try and write 
poems for you to erase the ones i’ve left memorized on your lips but her lines could never punch 
you in the stomach the way mine did. she will then try to make love to your body. but she will 
never lick, caress, or suck like me. she will be a sad replacement of the woman you let slip. 
nothing she does will excite you and this will break her. when she is tired of falling apart for a 
man that doesn’t give back what he takes she will recognize me in your eyelids staring at her with 
pity and it’ll hit her. how can she love a man who is busy loving someone he can never get his 
hands on again.


the next time you
have your coffee black 
you’ll taste the bitter 
state he left you in
it will make you weep 
but you’ll never
stop drinking
you’d rather have the 
darkest parts of him 
than have nothing



more than anything 
i want to save you 
from myself


you have spent enough nights
with his manhood curled inside your legs 
to forget what loneliness feels like




you whisper
i love you
what you mean is
i don’t want you to leave


that’s the
thing about love
it marinates your lips 
till the only word your 
mouth remembers
is his name




it must hurt to know 
i am your most 
beautiful
regret


i didn’t leave because 
i stopped loving you
i left because the longer 
i stayed the less
i loved myself



you mustn’t have to 
make them want you
they must want you themselves


 



did you think i was a city
big enough for a weekend getaway 
i am the town surrounding it
the one you’ve never heard of 
but always pass through
there are no neon lights here 
no skyscrapers or statues 
but there is thunder
for i make bridges tremble
i am not street meat i am homemade jam 
thick enough to cut the sweetest
thing your lips will touch 
i am not police sirens
i am the crackle of a fireplace 
i’d burn you and you still 
couldn’t take your eyes off me
cause i’d look so beautiful doing it 
you’d blush
i am not a hotel room i am home 
i am not the whiskey you want
i am the water you need
don’t come here with expectations 
and try to make a vacation out of me


the one who arrives after you 
will remind me love is 
supposed to be soft

he will taste 
like the poetry
i wish i could write


if
he can’t help but 
degrade other women 
when they’re not looking 
if toxicity is central
to his language 
he could hold you
in his lap and be soft 
honey
that man could feed you sugar and 
douse you in rose water
but that still could not 
make him sweet

-	if you want to know the type of man he is





i am a museum full of art 
but you had your eyes shut


you must have known 
you were wrong 
when your fingers
were dipped inside me 
searching for honey that 
would not come for you





the thing
worth holding on to 
would not have let go


when you are broken 
and he has left you 
do not question 
whether you were 
enough
the problem was 
you were so enough
he was not able to carry it




love made the danger 
in you look like safety


even when you undress her 
you are searching for me
i am sorry i 
taste so good
when the two of you 
make love it is
still my name 
that rolls off your 
tongue accidently





you treat them like they 
have a heart like yours
but not everyone can be as 
soft and as tender

you don’t see the 
person they are 
you see the person
they have the potential to be

you give and give till
they pull everything out of you 
and leave you empty


i had to leave 
i was tired of
allowing you to 
make me feel 
anything less 
than whole




you were the most beautiful thing i’d ever felt till now. and i was convinced you’d remain the 
most beautiful thing i’d ever feel. do you know how limiting that is. to think at such a ripe young 
age i’d experienced the most exhilarating person i’d ever meet. how i’d spend the rest of my life 
just settling. to think i’d tasted the rawest form of honey and everything else would be refined and 
synthetic. that nothing beyond this point would add up. that all the years beyond me could not 
combine themselves to be sweeter than you.

-	falsehood


i don’t know what living a balanced life feels like 
when i am sad
i don’t cry i pour 
when i am happy
i don’t smile i glow 
when i am angry
i don’t yell i burn

the good thing about feeling in extremes is 
when i love i give them wings
but perhaps that isn’t 
such a good thing cause 
they always tend to leave 
and you should see me 
when my heart is broken 
i don’t grieve
i shatter




i came all this way
to give you all these things 
but you aren’t even looking


 

the abused 
and the 
abuser

-	i have been both


i am undoing you 
from my skin


 

it wasn’t you i was kissing
— don’t be mistaken

it was him on my mind
your lips were just convenient


it always comes back to you 
boils
circles 
itches
its way back to you


i was music
but you had your ears cut off




my tongue is sour 
from the hunger of 
missing you


i will not have you 
build me into your life 
when
what i want is to 
build a life with you

-	the difference



rivers fall from my mouth 
tears my eyes can’t carry


you are snakeskin
and i keep shedding you somehow 
my mind is forgetting
every exquisite detail 
of your face
the letting go has 
become the forgetting 
which is the most
pleasant and saddest thing 
to have happened




you were not wrong for leaving 
you were wrong for coming back 
and thinking
you could have me 
when it was convenient
and leave when it was not


how can i write
if he took my hands 
with him



neither of us is happy
but neither of us wants to leave 
so we keep breaking one another 
and calling it love


we began 
with honesty 
let us end
in it too

-	us



your voice 
alone 
drives me 
to tears


i don’t know why 
i split myself open
for others knowing 
sewing myself up 
hurts this much 
afterward




people go 
but how 
they left 
always stays


love is not cruel 
we are cruel
love is not a game
we have made a game 
out of love




how can our love die 
if it’s written
in these pages


even after the hurt 
the loss
the pain
the breaking 
your body is still 
the only one
i want to be 
undressed under




the night after you left 
i woke up so broken
the only place to put the pieces 
were the bags under my eyes


stay
i whispered 
as you
shut the door behind you




i am confident i am over you. so much that some mornings i wake up with a smile on my face and 
my hands pressed together thanking the universe for pulling you out of me. thank god i cry. thank 
god you left. i would not be the empire i am today if you had stayed.

but then.

there are some nights i imagine what i might do if you showed up. how if you walked into the 
room this very second every awful thing you’ve ever done would be tossed out the closest 
window and all the love would rise up again. it would pour through my eyes as if it never really 
left in the first place. as if it’s been practicing how to stay silent so long only so it could be this 
loud on your arrival. can someone explain that. how even when the love leaves. it doesn’t leave. 
how even when i am so past you. i am so helplessly brought back to you.


he isn’t coming back 
whispered my head 
he has to
sobbed my heart

-	wilting



i don’t want to be friends 
i want all of you

-	more


i am losing parts of you like i lose eyelashes 
unknowingly and everywhere



you cannot leave 
and have me too 
i cannot exist in
two places at once

-	when you ask if we can still be friends


i am water

soft enough 
to offer life 
tough enough
to drown it away




what i miss most is how you loved me. but what i didn’t know was how you loved me had so 
much to do with the person i was. it was a reflection of everything i gave to you. coming back to 
me. how did i not see that. how. did i sit here soaking in the idea that no one else would love me 
that way. when it was i that taught you. when it was i that showed you how to fill. the way i 
needed to be filled. how cruel i was to myself. giving you credit for my warmth simply because 
you had felt it. thinking it was you who gave me strength. wit. beauty. simply because you 
recognized it. as if i was already not these things before i met you. as if i did not remain all these 
once you left.


you leave
but you don’t stay gone 
why do you do that 
why do you
abandon the thing you want to keep 
why do you linger
in a place you do not want to stay 
why do you think it’s okay to do both 
go and return all at once





i will tell you about selfish people. even when they know they will hurt you they walk into your 
life to taste you because you are the type of being they don’t want to miss out on. you are too 
much shine to not be felt. so when they have gotten a good look at everything you have to offer. 
when they have taken your skin your hair your secrets with them. when they realize how real this 
is. how much of a storm you are and it hits them.

that is when the cowardice sets in. that is when the person you thought they were is replaced by 
the sad reality of what they are. that is when they lose every fighting bone in their body and leave 
after saying you will find better than me.

you will stand there naked with half of them still hidden somewhere inside you and sob. asking 
them why they did it. why they forced you to love them when they had no intention of loving you 
back and they’ll say something along the lines of i just had to try. i had to give it a chance. it was 
you after all.

but that isn’t romantic. it isn’t sweet. the idea that they were so engulfed by your existence they 
had to risk breaking it for the sake of knowing they weren’t the one missing out. your existence 
meant that little next to their curiosity of you.

that is the thing about selfish people. they gamble entire beings. entire souls to please their own. 
one second they are holding you like the world in their lap and the next they have belittled you to 
a mere picture. a moment. something of the past. one second. they swallow you up and whisper 
they want to spend the rest of their life with you. but the moment they sense fear. they are already 
halfway out the door. without having the nerve to let you go with grace. as if the human heart 
means that little to them.

and after all this. after all of the taking. the nerve. isn’t it sad and funny how people have more 
guts these days to undress you with their fingers than they do to pick up the phone and call. 
apologize. for the loss. and this is how you lose her.

-	selfish


1.	take refuge in your bed.
2.	cry. till the tears stop (this will take a few days).
3.	don’t listen to slow songs.
4.	delete their number from your phone even though it is memorized on your fingertips.
5.	don’t look at old photos.
6.	find the closest ice cream shop and treat yourself to two scoops of mint chocolate chip. the mint 
will calm your heart. you deserve the chocolate.
7.	buy new bed sheets.
8.	collect all the gifts, t-shirts, and everything with their smell on it and drop it off at a donation 
center.
9.	plan a trip.
10.	perfect the art of smiling and nodding when someone brings their name up in conversation.
11.	start a new project.
12.	whatever you do. do not call.
13.	do not beg for what does not want to stay.
14.	stop crying at some point.
15.	allow yourself to feel foolish for believing you could’ve built the rest of your life in someone 
else’s stomach.
16.	breathe.


the way they 
leave
tells you 
everything








 


perhaps
i don’t deserve 
nice things
cause i am paying 
for sins i don’t 
remember




the thing about writing is 
i can’t tell if it’s healing 
or destroying me


do not bother holding on to
that thing that does not want you

- you cannot make it stay




you must enter a relationship 
with yourself
before anyone else


accept that you deserve more 
than painful love
life is moving
the healthiest thing 
for your heart is
to move with it




it is a part of the
human experience to feel pain 
do not be afraid
open yourself to it

- evolving


 

loneliness is a sign you are in desperate need of yourself


you are in the habit 
of co-depending 
on people to
make up for what 
you think you lack

who tricked you 
into believing 
another person
was meant to complete you
when the most they can do is complement


do not look for healing 
at the feet of those 
who broke you




if you were born with 
the weakness to fall 
you were born with 
the strength to rise


perhaps the saddest of all 
are those who live waiting 
for someone they’re not 
sure exists

- 7 billion people





stay strong through your pain 
grow flowers from it
you have helped me
grow flowers out of mine so 
bloom beautifully 
dangerously
loudly 
bloom softly
however you need 
just bloom

-	to the reader


i thank the universe 
for taking
everything it has taken 
and giving to me 
everything it is giving

-	balance




it takes grace 
to remain kind
in cruel situations


fall
in love
with your solitude





there is a difference between 
someone telling you
they love you and 
them actually 
loving you


sometimes 
the apology 
never comes
when it is wanted

and when it comes 
it is neither wanted 
nor needed

-	you are too late




you tell me
i am not like most girls
and learn to kiss me with your eyes closed 
something about the phrase—something about 
how i have to be unlike the women
i call sisters in order to be wanted 
makes me want to spit your tongue out
like i am supposed to be proud you picked me 
as if i should be relieved you think
i am better than them


the next time he 
points out the
hair on your legs is 
growing back remind 
that boy your body
is not his home 
he is a guest 
warn him to 
never outstep 
his welcome 
again





to be 
soft 
is
to be 
powerful


you deserve to be 
completely found
in your surroundings 
not lost within them





i know it’s hard 
believe me
i know it feels like 
tomorrow will never come 
and today will be the most 
difficult day to get through
but i swear you will get through 
the hurt will pass
as it always does
if you give it time and 
let it so let it
go 
slowly
like a broken promise 
let it go


i like the way the stretch marks 
on my thighs look human and 
that we’re so soft yet
rough and jungle wild 
when we need to be
i love that about us
how capable we are of feeling 
how unafraid we are of breaking 
and tend to our wounds with grace 
just being a woman
calling myself 
a woman
makes me utterly whole 
and complete




my issue with what they consider beautiful 
is their concept of beauty
centers around excluding people 
i find hair beautiful
when a woman wears it 
like a garden on her skin
that is the definition of beauty 
big hooked noses
pointing upward to the sky 
like they’re rising
to the occasion
skin the color of earth
my ancestors planted crops on 
to feed a lineage of women with 
thighs thick as tree trunks
eyes like almonds
deeply hooded with conviction 
the rivers of punjab
flow through my bloodstream so 
don’t tell me my women
aren’t as beautiful 
as the ones in 
your country


our backs 
tell stories
no books have 
the spine to 
carry

-	women of color


 


accept yourself
as you were designed


your body
is a museum
of natural disasters 
can you grasp how 
stunning that is




losing you
was the becoming 
of myself


other women’s bodies 
are not our battlegrounds



removing all the hair 
off your body is okay
if that’s what you want to do
just as much as keeping all the hair 
on your body is okay
if that’s what you want to do

-	you belong only to yourself


apparently it is ungraceful of me 
to mention my period in public 
cause the actual biology
of my body is too real

it is okay to sell what’s 
between a woman’s legs 
more than it is okay to 
mention its inner workings

the recreational use of 
this body is seen as 
beautiful while
its nature is 
seen as ugly




you were a dragon long before 
he came around and said
you could fly

you will remain a dragon 
long after he’s left


i want to apologize to all the women 
i have called pretty
before i’ve called them intelligent or brave 
i am sorry i made it sound as though
something as simple as what you’re born with 
is the most you have to be proud of when your 
spirit has crushed mountains
from now on i will say things like
you are resilient or you are extraordinary
not because i don’t think you’re pretty
but because you are so much more than that





i have
what i have 
and i am happy

i’ve lost
what i’ve lost 
and i am
still 
happy

-	outlook


you look at me and cry
everything hurts

i hold you and whisper
but everything can heal




if the hurt comes
so will the happiness

-	be patient








 


the name kaur
makes me a free woman
it removes the shackles that 
try to bind me
uplifts me
to remind me i am equal to 
any man even though the state
of this world screams to me i am not 
that i am my own woman and
i belong wholly to myself 
and the universe
it humbles me
calls out and says i have a 
universal duty to share with 
humanity to nurture
and serve the sisterhood
to raise those that need raising 
the name kaur runs in my blood
it was in me before the word itself existed 
it is my identity and my liberation

-	kaur
a woman of sikhi


 

the world 
gives you
so much pain 
and here you are
making gold out of it

-	there is nothing purer than that


how you love yourself is 
how you teach others
to love you


my heart aches for sisters more than anything 
it aches for women helping women
like flowers ache for spring




the goddess between your legs 
makes mouths water


you
are your own 
soul mate




some people 
are so bitter

to them
you must be kindest


we all move forward when 
we recognize how resilient 
and striking the women 
around us are




for you to see beauty here 
does not mean
there is beauty in me
it means there is beauty rooted 
so deep within you
you can’t help but 
see it everywhere


hair
if it was not supposed to be there 
would not be growing
on our bodies in the first place

-	we are at war with what comes most naturally to us



most importantly love
like it’s the only thing you know how 
at the end of the day all this
means nothing 
this page
where you’re sitting 
your degree
your job 
the money
nothing even matters
except love and human connection 
who you loved
and how deeply you loved them
how you touched the people around you 
and how much you gave them


i want to remain so 
rooted to the ground 
these tears
these hands 
these feet 
sink in

-	grounded




you have to stop
searching for why at some point 
you have to leave it alone


if you are not enough for yourself 
you will never be enough
for someone else



you must 
want to spend
the rest of your life 
with yourself
first


of course i want to be successful 
but i don’t crave success for me 
i need to be successful to gain 
enough milk and honey
to help those around 
me succeed




my heartbeat quickens at
the thought of birthing poems 
which is why i will never stop 
opening myself up to conceive them 
the lovemaking
to the words 
is so erotic
i am either in love 
or in lust with
the writing 
or both


what terrifies me most is how we 
foam at the mouth with envy 
when others succeed
but sigh in relief 
when they are failing

our struggle to 
celebrate each other is
what’s proven most difficult 
in being human


 


your art
is not about how many people 
like your work
your art 
is about
if your heart likes your work 
if your soul likes your work 
it’s about how honest
you are with yourself 
and you
must never 
trade honesty 
for relatability

-	to all you young poets


give to those
who have nothing 
to give to you

-	seva (selfless service)




you split me open 
in the most honest 
way there is
to split a soul open 
and forced me to write 
at a time i was sure i 
could not write again

-	thank you


 


you have made it to the end. with my heart in your hands. thank you. for arriving here safely. for 
being tender with the most delicate part of me. sit down. breathe. you must be tired. let me kiss 
your hands. your eyes. they must be wanting of something sweet. i am sending you all my sugar. i 
would be nowhere and nothing if it were not for you. you’ve helped me become the woman i 
wanted to be. but was too afraid to be. do you have any idea how much of a miracle you are. how 
lovely it’s been. and how lovely it will always be. i am kneeling before you. saying thank you. i 
am sending my love to your eyes. may they always see goodness in people. and may you always 
practice kindness. may we see each other as one. may we be nothing short of in love with 
everything the universe has to offer. and may we always stay grounded. rooted. our feet planted 
firmly onto the earth.

-	a love letter from me to you


bees came for honey 
flowers giggled as they 
undressed themselves 
for the taking 
the sun smiled 


-the second birth 

on the last day of love 
my heart cracked inside my body 




i spent the entire night 
casting spells to bring you back 




i reached for the last bouquet of flowers 
you gave me 
now wilting in their vase 
one 
by 
one 
i popped their heads off 
and ate them 




i stuffed a towel at the foot of every door 
leave i told the air 
i have no use for you 


i drew every curtain in the house 
go i told the light 
no one is coming in 
and no one is going out 


-cemetery 

you left 
and i wanted you still 
yet i deserved someone 
who was willing to stay 




i spend days in bed debilitated by loss 
i attempt to cry you back 
but the water is done 
and still you have not returned 
i pinch my belly till it bleeds 
have lost count of the days 
sun becomes moon and 
moon becomes sun and 
i become ghost 
a dozen different thoughts 
tear through me each second 
you must be on your way 
perhaps it’s best if you’re not 
i am okay 
no 
i am angry 
yes 
i hate you 
maybe 
i can’t move on 
i will 
i forgive you 
i want to rip my hair out 
over and over and over again 
till my mind exhausts itself into a silence 



yesterday 
the rain tried to imitate my hands 
by running down your body 
i ripped the sky apart for allowing it 


-jealousy 

in order to fall asleep 
i have to imagine your body 
crooked behind mine 
spoon ladled into spoon 
till i can hear your breath 
i have to recite your name 
till you answer and 
we have a conversation 
only then 
can my mind 
drift off to sleep 


-pretend 

it isn’t what we left behind 
that breaks me 
it’s what we could’ve built 
had we stayed 




i can still see our construction hats lying 
exactly where we left them 
pylons unsure of what to guard 
bulldozers gazing out for our return 
the planks of wood stiff in their boxes 
yearning to be nailed up 
but neither of us goes back 
to tell them it is over 
in time 
the bricks will grow tired of waiting and crumble 
the cranes will droop their necks in sorrow 
the shovels will rust 
do you think flowers will grow here 
when you and i are off 
building something new 
with someone else 


-the construction site of our future 

i live for that first second in the morning 
when i am still half-conscious 
i hear the hummingbirds outside 
flirting with the flowers 
i hear the flowers giggling 
and the bees growing jealous 
when i turn over to wake you 
it starts all over again 
the panting 
the wailing 
the shock 
of realizing 
that you’ve left 


-the first mornings without you 

the hummingbirds tell me 
you’ve changed your hair 
i tell them i don’t care 
while listening to them 
describe every detail 


-hunger 

i envy the winds 
who still witness you 




i could be anything 
in the world 
but i wanted to be his 



i tried to leave many times but 
as soon as i got away 
my lungs buckled under the pressure 
panting for air i’d return 
perhaps this is why i let you 
skin me to the bone 
something 
was better than nothing 
having you touch me 
even if it was not kind 
was better than not having your hands at all 
i could take the abuse 
i could not take the absence 
i knew i was beating a dead thing 
but did it matter 
if the thing was dead 
when at the very least 
i had it 


-addiction 

you break women in like shoes 



loving you was breathing 
but that breath disappearing 
before it filled my lungs 


-when it goes too soon 

what love looks like 


what does love look like the therapist asks 
one week after the breakup 
and i’m not sure how to answer her question 
except for the fact that i thought love 
looked so much like you 


that’s when it hit me 
and i realized how naive i had been 
to place an idea so beautiful on the image of a person 
as if anybody on this entire earth 
could encompass all love represented 
as if this emotion seven billion people tremble for 
would look like a five foot eleven 
medium-sized brown-skinned guy 
who likes eating frozen pizza for breakfast 


what does love look like the therapist asks again 
this time interrupting my thoughts midsentence 
and at this point i’m about to get up 
and walk right out the door 
except i paid far too much money for this hour 
so instead i take a piercing look at her 
the way you look at someone 
when you’re about to hand it to them 
lips pursed tightly preparing to launch into conversation 
eyes digging deeply into theirs 
searching for all the weak spots 
they have hidden somewhere 
hair being tucked behind the ears 
as if you have to physically prepare for a conversation 



on the philosophies or rather disappointments 
of what love looks like 


well i tell her 
i don’t think love is him anymore 


if love was him 
he would be here wouldn’t he 
if he was the one for me 
wouldn’t he be the one sitting across from me 
if love was him it would have been simple 
i don’t think love is him 
anymore i repeat 
i think love never was 
i think i just wanted something 
was ready to give myself to something 
i believed was bigger than myself 
and when i saw someone 
who could probably fit the part 
i made it very much my intention 
to make him my counterpart 


and i lost myself to him 
he took and he took 
wrapped me in the word special 
until i was so convinced he had eyes only to see me 
hands only to feel me 
a body only to be with me 
oh how he emptied me 


how does that make you feel 


interrupts the therapist 


well i said 


it kind of makes me feel like shit 


maybe we’re all looking at it wrong 
we think it’s something to search for out there 
something meant to crash into us 
on our way out of an elevator 



or slip into our chair at a cafe somewhere 
appear at the end of an aisle at the bookstore 
looking the right amount of sexy and intellectual 
but i think love starts here 
everything else is just desire and projection 
of all our wants needs and fantasies 
but those externalities could never work out 
if we didn’t turn inward and learn 
how to love ourselves in order to love other people 


love does not look like a person 
love is our actions 
love is giving all we can 
even if it’s just the bigger slice of cake 
love is understanding 
we have the power to hurt one another 
but we are going to do everything in our power 
to make sure we don’t 
love is figuring out all the kind sweetness we deserve 
and when someone shows up 
saying they will provide it as you do 
but their actions seem to break you 
rather than build you 
love is knowing whom to choose 



you cannot 
walk in and out of me 
like a revolving door 
i have too many miracles 
happening inside me 
to be your convenient option 


-not your hobby 

you took the sun with you 
when you left 




i remained committed 
long after you were gone 
i could not lift my eyes 
to meet eyes with someone else 
looking felt like betrayal 
what excuse would i have 
when you came back 
and asked where my hands had been 


-loyal 

when you plunged the knife into me 
you also began bleeding 
my wound became your wound 
didn’t you know 
love is a double-edged knife 
you will suffer the way you make me suffer 




i think my body knew you would not stay 




i long 
for you 
but you long 
for someone else 
i deny the one 
who wants me 
cause i want someone else 


-the human condition 

i wonder if i am 
beautiful enough for you 
or if i am beautiful at all 
i change what i am wearing 
five times before i see you 
wondering which pair of jeans will make 
my body more tempting to undress 
tell me 
is there anything i can do 
to make you think 


her 
she is so striking 
she makes my body forget it has knees 


write it in a letter and address it 
to all the insecure parts of me 
your voice alone drives me to tears 
yours telling me i am beautiful 
yours telling me i am enough 



you’re everywhere 
except right here 
and it hurts 




show me a picture 
i want to see the face of the woman 
who made you forget the one you had at home 
what day was it and 
what excuse did you feed me 
i used to thank the universe 
for bringing you to me 
did you enter her right as 
i asked the almighty 
to grant you all you wanted 
did you find it in her 
did you come crawling out of her 
with what you couldn’t in me 



what draws you to her 
tell me what you like 
so i can practice 




your absence is a missing limb 



questions 


there is a list of questions 
i want to ask but never will 
there is a list of questions 
i go through in my head 
every time i’m alone 
and my mind can’t stop itself from searching for you 
there is a list of questions i want to ask 
so if you’re listening somewhere 
here i am asking them 


what do you think happens 
to the love that’s left behind 
when two lovers leave 
how blue do you think it gets 
before it passes away 
does it pass away 
or does it still exist somewhere 
waiting for us to come back 
when we lied to ourselves by 
calling this unconditional and left 
which one of us hurt more 
i shattered into a million little pieces 
and those pieces shattered into a million more 
crumbled into dust till 
there was nothing left of me but the silence 


tell me how love 
how did the grieving feel for you 
how did the mourning hurt 
how did you peel your eyes open after every blink 



knowing i’d never be there staring back 


it must be hard to live with what ifs 
there must always be this constant dull aching 
in the pit of your stomach 
trust me 
i feel it too 
how in the world did we get here 
how did we live through it 
and how are we still living 


how many months did it take 
before you stopped thinking of me 
or are you still thinking of me 
cause if you are 
then maybe i am too 
thinking of you 
thinking of me 
with me 
in me 
around me 
everywhere 
you and me and us 


do you still touch yourself to thoughts of me 
do you still imagine my naked naked tiny tiny body 
pressed into yours 
do you still imagine the curve of my spine and 
how you wanted to rip it out of me 
cause the way it dipped into my 
perfectly rounded bottom 
drove you crazy 


baby 
sugar baby 
sweet baby 
ever since we left 



how many times did you pretend 
it was my hand stroking you 
how many times did you search for me in your fantasies 
and end up crying instead of coming 
don’t you lie to me 
i can tell when you’re lying 
cause there’s always that little bit of 
arrogance in your response 


are you angry with me 
are you okay 
and would you tell me if you’re not 
and if we ever see each other again 
do you think you’d reach out and hold me 
like you said you would 
the last time we spoke and 
you talked of the next time we would 
or do you think we’d just look 
shake in our skin as we pine to 
absorb as much as we can of each other 
cause by this time we’ve probably got 
someone else waiting at home 
we were good together weren’t we 
and is it wrong that i’m asking you these questions 
tell me love 
that you have been 
looking for these answers too 



you call to tell me you miss me 
i turn to face the front door of the house 
waiting for a knock 
days later you call to say you need me 
but still aren’t here 
the dandelions on the lawn 
are rolling their eyes in disappointment 
the grass has declared you yesterday’s news 
what do i care 
if you love me 
or miss me 
or need me 
when you aren’t doing anything about it 
if i’m not the love of your life 
i’ll be the greatest loss instead 



where do we go from here my love 
when it’s over and i’m standing between us 
whose side do i run to 
when every nerve in my body is pulsing for you 
when my mouth waters at the thought 
when you are pulling me in just by standing there 
how do i turn around and choose myself 




day by day i realize 
everything i miss about you 
was never there in the first place 


-the person i fell in love with was a mirage 

they leave 
and act like it never happened 
they come back 
and act like they never left 


-ghosts 

i tried to find it 
but there was no answer 
at the end of the last conversation 


-closure 

you ask 
if we can still be friends 
i explain how a honeybee 
does not dream of kissing 
the mouth of a flower 
and then settle for its leaves 


-i don’t need more friends 

why is it 
that when the story ends 
we begin to feel all of it 



rise 


said the moon 
and the new day came 
the show must go on said the sun 
life does not stop for anybody 
it drags you by the legs 
whether you want to move forward or not 
that is the gift 
life will force you to forget how you long for them 
your skin will shed till there is not 
a single part of you left they’ve touched 
your eyes finally just your eyes 
not the eyes which held them 
you will make it to the end 
of what is only the beginning 
go on 
open the door to the rest of it 


-time 

i notice everything i do not have 
and decide it is beautiful 




i hardened under the last loss. it took something human out of me. i used to 
be so deeply emotional i’d crumble on demand. but now the water has made 
its exit. of course i care about the ones around me. i’m just struggling to 
show it. a wall is getting in the way. i used to dream of being so strong 
nothing could shake me. now. i am. so strong. that nothing shakes me. 
and all i dream is to soften. 


-numbness 

yesterday 
when i woke up 
the sun fell to the ground and rolled away 
flowers beheaded themselves 
all that’s left alive here is me 
and i barely feel like living 


-depression is a shadow living inside me 

why are you so unkind to me 


my body cries 


cause you don’t look like them 


i tell her 



you are waiting for someone 
who is not coming back 
meaning 
you are living your life 
hoping that someone will realize 
they can’t live theirs without you 


-realizations don’t work like that 

a lot of times 
we are angry at other people 
for not doing what 
we should have done for ourselves 


-responsibility 

why 
did you leave a door 
hanging 
open between my legs 
were you lazy 
did you forget 
or did you purposely leave me unfinished 


-conversations with god 

they did not tell me it would hurt like this 
no one warned me 
about the heartbreak we experience with friends 
where are the albums i thought 
there were no songs sung for it 
i could not find the ballads 
or read the books dedicated to writing the grief 
we fall into when friends leave 
it is the type of heartache that 
does not hit you like a tsunami 
it is a slow cancer 
the kind that does not show up for months 
has no visible signs 
is an ache here 
a headache there 
but manageable 
cancer or tsunami 
it all ends the same 
a friend or a lover 
a loss is a loss is a loss 


-the underrated heartache 

i hear a thousand kind words about me 
and it makes no difference 
yet i hear one insult 
and all confidence shatters 


-focusing on the negative 

home 


it began as a typical thursday from what i recall 
sunlight kissed my eyelids good morning 
i remember it exactly 
climbing out of bed 
making coffee to the sound of children playing outside 
putting music on 
loading the dishwasher 
i remember placing flowers in a vase 
in the middle of the kitchen table 
only when my apartment was spotless 
did i step into the bathtub 
wash yesterday out of my hair 
i decorated myself 
like the walls of my home were decorated 
with frames bookshelves photos 
i hung a necklace around my neck 
hooked earrings in 
applied lipstick like paint 
swept my hair back—just your typical thursday 


we ended up at a get-together with friends 
at the end you asked if i needed a ride home and 
i said yes cause our dads worked at the same company 
and you’d been to my place for dinner many times 


but i should have known 
when you began to confuse 
kind conversation with flirtation 
when you told me to let my hair down 
when instead of driving me home 


toward the bright intersection 
of lights and life—you took a left 
to the road that led nowhere 
i asked where we were going 
you asked if i was afraid 
my voice threw itself over the edge of my throat 
landed at the bottom of my belly and hid for months 
all the different parts in me 
turned the lights off 
shut the blinds 
locked the doors 
while i hid at the back of some 
upstairs closet of my mind as 
someone broke the windows—you 
kicked the front door in—you 
took everything 
and then someone took me 
—it was you. 


who dove into me with a fork and a knife 
eyes glinting with starvation 
like you hadn’t eaten in weeks 
i was a hundred and ten pounds of fresh meat 
you skinned and gutted with your fingers 
like you were scraping the inside of a cantaloupe clean 
as i screamed for my mother 
you nailed my wrists to the ground 
turned my breasts into bruised fruit 


this home is empty now 
no gas 
no electricity 
no running water 
the food is rotten 
from head to foot i am layered in dust 
fruit flies. webs. bugs. 



someone call the plumber 
my stomach is backed up—i’ve been vomiting since 
call the electrician 
my eyes won’t light up 
call the cleaners to wash me up and hang me to dry 


when you broke into my home 
it never felt like mine again 
i can’t even let a lover in without getting sick 
i lose sleep after the first date 
lose my appetite 
become more bone and less skin 
forget to breathe 
every night my bedroom becomes a psych ward 
where panic attacks turn men 
into doctors to keep me calm 
every lover who touches me—feels like you 
their fingers—you 
mouths—you 
until they’re not the ones 
on top of me anymore—it’s you 


and i am so tired 
of doing things your way 
—it isn’t working 
i’ve spent years trying to figure out 
how i could have stopped it 
but the sun can’t stop the storm from coming 
the tree can’t stop the ax 
i can’t blame myself for a having a hole 
the size of your manhood in my chest anymore 
it’s too heavy to carry your guilt—i’m setting it down 
i’m tired of decorating this place with your shame 
as if it belongs to me 
it’s too much to walk around with 
what your hands have done 



if it’s not my hands that have done it 


the truth comes to me suddenly—after years of rain 
the truth comes like sunlight 
pouring through an open window 
it takes a long time to get here 
but it all comes full circle 
it takes a broken person to come searching 
for meaning between my legs 
it takes a complete. whole. perfectly designed 
person to survive it 
it takes monsters to steal souls 
and fighters to reclaim them 
this home is what i came into this world with 
was the first home 
will be the last home 
you can’t take it 
there is no space for you 
no welcome mat 
no extra bedrooms 
i’m opening all the windows 
airing it out 
putting flowers in a vase 
in the middle of the kitchen table 
lighting a candle 
loading the dishwasher with all of my thoughts 
until they’re spotless 
scrubbing the countertops 
and then 
i plan to step into the bathtub 
wash yesterday out of my hair 
decorate my body in gold 
put music on 
sit back 
put my feet up 
and enjoy 


this typical thursday afternoon 




when snow falls 
i long for grass 
when grass grows 
i walk all over it 
when leaves change color 
i beg for flowers 
when flowers bloom 
i pick them 


-unappreciative 

tell them i was the 
warmest place you knew 
and you turned me cold 




at home that night 
i filled the bathtub with scorching water 
tossed in spearmint from the garden 
two tablespoons almond oil 
some milk 
and honey 
a pinch of salt 
rose petals from the neighbor’s lawn 
i soaked myself in the mixture 
desperate to wash the dirty off 
the first hour 
i picked pine needles from my hair 
counted them one two three 
lined them up on their backs 
the second hour 
i wept 
a howling escaped me 
who knew girl could become beast 
during the third hour 
i found bits of him on bits of me 
the sweat was not mine 
the white between my legs 
not mine 
the bite marks 
not mine 
the smell 
not mine 
the blood 
mine 
the fourth hour i prayed 



it felt like you threw me 
so far from myself 
i’ve been trying to find my way back ever since 




i reduced my body to aesthetics 
forgot the work it did to keep me alive 
with every beat and breath 
declared it a grand failure for not looking like theirs 
searched everywhere for a miracle 
foolish enough to not realize 
i was already living in one 



the irony of loneliness 
is we all feel it 
at the same time 


-together 

my girlhood was too much hair 
thin limbs coated in velvet 
it was neighborhood tradition 
for the other young girls and i 
to frequent basement salons on a weekly basis 
run by women in a house 
who were my mother’s age 
had my mother’s skin 
but looked nothing like my simple mother 
they had brown skin with 
yellow hair meant for white skin 
streaks like zebras 
slits for eyebrows 
i looked at my own caterpillars with shame 
and dreamt mine would be that thin 


i sit timidly in the makeshift waiting area 
hoping a friend from school would not drop by 
a bollywood music video is playing on a tiny 
television screen in the corner 
someone is getting their legs waxed or hair dyed 


when the auntie calls me in 
i walk into the room 
and make small talk 
she leaves for a moment 
while i undress my lower half 
i slide my pants and underwear off 
lie down on the spa bed and wait 
when she returns she positions my legs 
like an open butterfly 
soles of feet together 
knees pointing in opposite directions 
first the disinfectant wipe 
then the cold jelly 
how is school and what are you studying she asks 



turns the laser on 
places the head of the machine on my pubic bone 
and just like that it begins 
the hair follicles around 
my clitoris begin burning 
with each zap 
i wince 
shivering with pain 


why do i do this 
why do i punish my body 
for being exactly as it’s meant to be 
i stop myself halfway through the regret 
when i think of him and how 
i’m too embarrassed to show him 
unless it’s clean 


i bite down on my lip 
and ask if we’re almost finished

and forgot to enjoy the view 


-live fully 

you were mine 
and my life was full 
you are no longer mine 
and my life 
is full 




my eyes 
make mirrors out of 
every reflective surface they pass 
searching for something beautiful looking back 
my ears fish for compliments and praise 
but no matter how far they go looking 
nothing is enough for me 
i go to clinics and department stores 
for pretty potions and new techniques 
i’ve tried the lasers 
i’ve tried the facials 
i’ve tried the blades and expensive creams 
for a hopeful minute they fill me 
make me glow from cheek to cheek 
but as soon as i feel beautiful 
their magic disappears suddenly 
where am i supposed to find it 
i am willing to pay any price 
for a beauty that makes heads turn 
every moment day and night 


-a never-ending search 

this place makes me 
the kind of exhausted that has 
nothing to do with sleep 
and everything to do with 
the people around me 


-introvert 

you must see no worth in yourself 
if you find me worth less 
after you’ve touched me 
as if your hands on my body 
magnify you 
and reduce me to nothing 


-worth is not something we transfer 

you do not just wake up and become the butterfly 


-growth is a process 

i am having a difficult time right now 
comparing myself to other people 
i am stretching myself thin trying to be them 
making fun of my face like my father 
calling it ugly 
starving out this premature double chin before it 
melts into my shoulders like candle wax 
fixing the bags under my eyes that carry the rape 
bookmarking surgical procedures for my nose 
there is so much that needs tending to 
can you point me in the right direction 
i want to take this body off 
which way back to the womb 



like the rainbow 
after the rain 
joy will reveal itself 
after sorrow 




no was a bad word in my home 
no was met with the lash 
erased from our vocabulary 
beaten out of our backs 
till we became well-behaved kids 
who obediently nodded yes to everything 
when he climbed on top of me 
every part of my body wanted to reject it 
but i couldn’t say no to save my life 
when i tried to scream 
all that escaped me was silence 
i heard no pounding her fist 
on the roof of my mouth 
begging to let her out 
but i had not put up the exit sign 
never built the emergency staircase 
there was no trapdoor for no to escape from 
i want to ask all the 
parents and guardians a question 
what use was obedience then 
when there were hands 
that were not mine inside me 


-how can i verbalize consent as an adult if i was 
never taught to as a child 

despite knowing 
they won’t be here for long 
they still choose to live 
their brightest lives 


-sunflowers 

when you find her 
tell her not a day goes by 
when i do not think of her 
that girl who thinks you are 
everything she asked for 
when you bounce her off the walls 
and she cries 
tell her i cry with her too 
the sound of drywall crunching into itself 
as it’s beaten with her head 
also lives in my ears 
tell her to run to me 
i have already unscrewed 
my front door off its frame 
opened all the windows 
inside there is a warm bath running 
she does not need your kind of love 
i am proof she will get out 
and find her way back to herself 
if i could survive you 
so will she 



parts of my body still ache 
from the first time they were touched 




the art of growing 


i felt beautiful until the age of twelve 
when my body began to ripen like new fruit 
and suddenly 
the men looked at my newborn hips with salivating lips 
the boys didn’t want to play tag at recess 
they wanted to touch all the new 
and unfamiliar parts of me 
the parts i didn’t know how to wear 
didn’t know how to carry 
and tried to bury in my rib cage 


boobs 


they said 
and i hated that word 
hated that i was embarrassed to say it 
that even though it was referring to my body 
it didn’t belong to me 
it belonged to them 
and they repeated it like 
they were meditating upon it 


boobs 


he said 


let me see yours 


there is nothing worth seeing here but guilt and shame 
i try to rot into the earth below my feet 
but i am still standing one foot across 
from his hooked fingers 
and when he charges to feast on my half moons 
i bite into his forearm and decide i hate this body 
i must have done something terrible to deserve it 



when i go home i tell my mother 


the men outside are starving 


she tells me 
i must not dress with my breasts hanging 
said the boys will get hungry if they see fruit 
says i should sit with my legs closed 
like a woman oughta 
or the men will get angry and fight 
said i can avoid all this trouble 
if i just learn to act like a lady 
but the problem is 
that doesn’t even make sense 
i can’t wrap my head around the fact 
that i have to convince half the world’s population 
my body is not their bed 
i am busy learning the consequences of womanhood 
when i should be learning science and math instead 
i like cartwheels and gymnastics so i can’t imagine 
walking around with my thighs pressed together 
like they’re hiding a secret 
as if the acceptance of my own body parts 
will invite thoughts of lust in their heads 
i will not subject myself to their ideology 
cause slut shaming is rape culture 
virgin praising is rape culture 
i am not a mannequin in the window 
of your favorite shop 
you can’t dress me up or 
throw me out when i am worn 
you are not a cannibal 
your actions are not my responsibility 
you will control yourself 


the next time i go to school 
and the boys hoot at my backside 
i push them down 



foot over their necks 
and defiantly say 


boobs 


and the look in their eyes is priceless 



when the world comes crashing at your feet 
it’s okay to let others 
help pick up the pieces 
if we’re present to take part in your happiness 
when your circumstances are great 
we are more than capable 
of sharing your pain

it is possible 
to hate and love someone 
at the same time 
i do it to myself

somewhere along the way 
i lost the self-love 
and became my greatest enemy 
i thought i’d seen the devil before 
in the uncles who touched us as children 
the mobs that burned our city to the ground 
but i’d never seen someone as hungry 
for my flesh as i was 
i peeled my skin off just to feel awake 
wore it inside out 
sprinkled it with salt to punish myself 
turmoil clotted my nerves 
my blood curdled 
i even tried to bury myself alive 
but the dirt recoiled 
you have already rotted it said 
there is nothing left for me to do

the way you degrade yourself

when i hit the rock bottom 
that exists after the rock bottom 
and no rope or hand appeared 
i wondered 
what if nothing wants me 
because i do not want me 


-i am both the poison and the antidote 

first 
i went for my words 
the i can’ts. i won’ts. i am not good enoughs. 
i lined them up and shot them dead 
then i went for my thoughts 
invisible and everywhere 
there was no time to gather them one by one 
i had to wash them out 
i wove a linen cloth out of my hair 
soaked it in a bowl of mint and lemon water 
carried it in my mouth as i climbed 
up my braid to the back of my head 
down on my knees i began to wipe my mind clean 
it took twenty-one days 
my knees bruised but 
i did not care 
i was not given the breath 
in my lungs to choke it out 
i would scrub the self-hate off the bone 
till it exposed love 


-self-love 

i have survived far too much to go quietly 
let a meteor take me 
call the thunder for backup 
my death will be grand 
the land will crack 
the sun will eat itself 


-the day i leave 

i want to honeymoon myself 




if i am the longest relationship 
of my life 
isn’t it time to 
nurture intimacy 
and love 
with the person 
i lie in bed with each night 


-acceptance 

what is stronger 
than the human heart 
which shatters over and over 
and still lives

how naive to think healing was that easy 
when there is no end point 
no finish line to cross 
healing is everyday work

as she held me in her arms as i wept

in the garden each year

that people too 
must wilt

when it came to listening

if you are drowning their voice with yours 
how will you hear them she asked 


when it came to speaking 
she said do it with commitment 
every word you say 
is your own responsibility 


when it came to being 
she said be tender and tough at once 
you need to be vulnerable to live fully 
but rough enough to survive it all 


when it came to choosing 
she asked me to be thankful 
for the choices i had that 
she never had the privilege of making 


-lessons from mumma 

leaving her country 
was not easy for my mother 
i still catch her searching for it 
in foreign films 
and the international food aisle 




i wonder where she hid him. her brother who had died only a year before. as 
she sat in a costume of red silk and gold on her wedding day. she tells me it 
was the saddest day of her life. how she had not finished mourning yet. a 
year was not enough. there was no way to grieve that quick. it felt like a 
blink. a breath. before the news of his loss had sunk in the decor was already 
hung up. the guests had started strolling in. the small talk. the rush. all 
mirrored his funeral too much. it felt as though his body had just been 
carried away for the cremation when my father and his family arrived for the 
wedding celebrations.

this much sorrow to a shore

if drowning is easier than staying

1. you are allowed to say no 
2. years ago his father beat the language of love 
out of your husband’s back 
he will never know how to say it 
but his actions prove he loves you 
3. go with him 
when he enters your body and goes to that place 
sex is not dirty 
4. no matter how many times his family brings it up 
do not have the abortion just because i’m a girl 
lock the relatives out and swallow the key 
he will not hate you 
5. take your journals and paintings 
across the ocean when you leave 
these will remind you who you are 
when you get lost amid new cities 
they will also remind your children 
you had an entire life before them 
6. when your husbands are off 
working at the factories 
make friends with all the other 
lonely women in the apartment complex 
this loneliness will cut a person in half 
you will need each other to stay alive 
7. your husband and children will take from your plate 
we will emotionally and mentally starve you 
all of it is wrong 
don’t let us convince you that 

sacrificing yourself is 
how you must show love 


8. when your mother dies 
fly back for the funeral 
money comes and goes 
a mother is once in a lifetime 
9. you are allowed to spend 
a couple dollars on a coffee 
i know there was a time when 
we could not afford it 
but we are okay now. breathe. 
10. you can’t speak english fluently 
or operate a computer or cell phone 
we did that to you. it is not your fault. 
you are not any less than the 
other mothers with their 
flashy phones and designer clothing 
we confined you to the four walls of this home 
and worked you to the bone 
you have not been your own property for decades 
11. there was no rule book for how 
to be the first woman in your lineage 
to raise a family on a strange land by yourself 
12. you are the person i look up to most 
13. when i am about to shatter 
i think of your strength 
and harden 
14. i think you are a magician 
15. i want to fill the rest of your life with ease 

16. you are the hero of heroes 
the god of gods 

in a dream 
i saw my mother 
with the love of her life 
and no children 
it was the happiest i’d ever seen her 


-what if 

you split the world 
into pieces and 
called them countries 
declared ownership on 
what never belonged to you 
and left the rest with nothing 


-colonize 

my parents never sat us down in the evenings to share stories of their 
younger days. one was always working. the other too tired. perhaps being an 
immigrant does that to you. 


the cold terrain of the north engulfed them. their bodies were hard at work 
paying in blood and sweat for their citizenship. perhaps the weight of the 
new world was too much. and the pain and sorrow of the old was better left 
buried. 


i do wish i had unburied it though. i wish i’d pried their silence apart like a 
closed envelope. i wish i’d found a small opening at its very edge. pushed a 
finger inside and gently torn it open. they had an entire life before me which 
i am a stranger to. it would be my greatest regret to see them leave this place 
before i even got to know them. 



my voice 
is the offspring 
of two countries colliding 
what is there to be ashamed of 
if english 
and my mother tongue 
made love 
my voice 
is her father’s words 
and mother’s accent 
what does it matter if 
my mouth carries two worlds

for years they were separated by oceans 
left with nothing but little photographs of each other 
smaller than passport-size photos 
hers was tucked into a golden locket 
his slipped inside his wallet 
at the end of the day 
when their worlds went quiet 
studying them was their only intimacy 


this was a time long before computers 
when families in that part of the world 
had not seen a telephone or laid their 
almond eyes on a colored television screen 
long before you and i 


as the wheels of the plane touched tarmac 
she wondered if this was the place 
had she boarded the right flight 
should’ve asked the air hostess twice 
like her husband suggested 


walking into baggage claim 
her heart beat so heavy 
she thought it might fall out 
eyes darting in every direction 
searching for what to do next when 
suddenly 
right there 
in the flesh 
he stood 
not a mirage—a man 
first came relief 
then bewilderment 
they’d imagined this reunion for years 
had rehearsed their lines 
but her mouth seemed to forget 



she felt a kick in her stomach 
when she saw the shadows circling his eyes 
and shoulders carrying an invisible weight 
it looked like the life had been drained out of him 


where was the person she had wed 
she wondered 
reaching for the golden locket 
the one with the photo of the man 
her husband did not look like anymore 


-the new world had drained him 

what if 
there isn’t enough time 
to give her what she deserves 
do you think 
if i begged the sky hard enough 
my mother’s soul would 
return to me as my daughter 
so i can give her 
the comfort she gave me 
my whole life 



i want to go back in time and sit beside her. document her in a home movie 
so my eyes can spend the rest of their lives witnessing a miracle. the one 
whose life i never think of before mine. i want to know what she laughed 
about with friends. in the village within houses of mud and brick. surrounded 
by acres of mustard plant and sugarcane. i want to sit with the teenage 
version of my mother. ask about her dreams. become her pleated braid. the 
black kohl caressing her eyelids. the flour neatly packed into her fingertips. a 
page in her schoolbooks. even to be a single thread of her cotton dress would 
be the greatest gift.

broken english 


i think about the way my father 
pulled the family out of poverty 
without knowing what a vowel was 
and my mother raised four children 
without being able to construct 
a perfect sentence in english 
a discombobulated couple 
who landed in the new world with hopes 
that left the bitter taste of rejection in their mouths 
no family 
no friends 
just man and wife 
two university degrees that meant nothing 
one mother tongue that was broken now 
one swollen belly with a baby inside 
a father worrying about jobs and rent 
cause no matter what this baby was coming 
and they thought to themselves for a split second 


was it worth it to put all of our money 
into the dream of a country 
that is swallowing us whole 


papa looks at his woman’s eyes 
and sees loneliness living where the iris was 
wants to give her a home in a country that looks at her 
with the word visitor wrapped around its tongue 
on their wedding day 
she left an entire village to be his wife 
now she left an entire country to be a warrior 
and when the winter came 



they had nothing but the heat of their own bodies 
to keep the coldness out 


like two brackets they faced one another 
to hold the dearest parts of them—their children—close 
they turned a suitcase full of clothes into a life 
and regular paychecks 
to make sure the children of immigrants 
wouldn’t hate them for being the children of immigrants 
they worked too hard 
you can tell by their hands 
their eyes are begging for sleep 
but our mouths were begging to be fed 
and that is the most artistic thing i have ever seen 
it is poetry to these ears 
that have never heard what passion sounds like 
and my mouth is full of likes and ums when 
i look at their masterpiece 
cause there are no words in the english language 
that can articulate that kind of beauty 
i can’t compact their existence into twenty-six letters and call 
it a description 
i tried once 
but the adjectives needed to describe them 
don’t even exist 
so instead i ended up with pages and pages 
full of words followed by commas and 
more words and more commas 
only to realize there are some things 
in the world so infinite 
they could never use a full stop 


so how dare you mock your mother 
when she opens her mouth and 
broken english spills out 
don’t be ashamed of the fact that 



she split through countries to be here 
so you wouldn’t have to cross a shoreline 
her accent is thick like honey 
hold it with your life 
it’s the only thing she has left of home 
don’t you stomp on that richness 
instead hang it up on the walls of museums 
next to dali and van gogh 
her life is brilliant and tragic 
kiss the side of her tender cheek 
she already knows what it feels like 
to have an entire nation laugh when she speaks 
she is more than our punctuation and language 
we might be able to paint pictures and write stories 
but she made an entire world for herself 


how is that for art 




on the first day of love 
you wrapped me in the word special 




you must remember it too 
how the rest of the city slept 
while we sat awakened for the first time 
we hadn’t touched yet 
but we managed to travel in and out 
of each other with our words 
our limbs dizzying with enough electricity 
to form half a sun 
we drank nothing that night 
but i was intoxicated 
i went home and thought 


are we soul mates 



i feel apprehensive 
cause falling into you 
means falling out of him and 
i had not prepared for that 


-forward 

how do i welcome in kindness 
when i have only practiced 
spreading my legs for the terrifying 
what am i to do with you 
if my idea of love is violence 
but you are sweet 
if your concept of passion is eye contact 
but mine is rage 
how can i call this intimacy 
if i crave sharp edges 
but your edges aren’t even edges 
they are soft landings 
how do i teach myself 
to accept a healthy love 
if all i’ve ever known is pain 



i will welcome 
a partner 
who is my equal 




never feel guilty for starting again 



the middle place is strange 
the part between them and the next 
is an awakening from how you saw to 
how you will see 
this is where their charm wears off 
where they are no longer 
the god you made them out to be 
when the pedestal you carved out of your 
bone and teeth no longer serves them 
they are unmasked and made mortal again 


-the middle place 

when you start loving someone new 
you laugh at the indecisiveness of love 
remember when you were sure 
the last one was the one 
and now here you are 
redefining the one all over again 


-a fresh love is a gift 

i do not need the kind of love 
that is draining 
i want someone 
who energizes me 




i am trying to not 
make you pay for their mistakes 
i am trying to teach myself 
you are not responsible 
for the wound 
how can i punish you 
for what you have not done 
you wear my emotions 
like a decorated army vest 
you are not cold or 
savage or hungry 
you are medicinal 
you are not them 



he makes sure to look right at me 
as he places his electric fingers on my skin 
how does that feel he asks 
commanding my attention 
responding is out of the question 
i quiver with anticipation 
excited and terrified for what’s to come 
he smiles 
knows this is what satisfaction looks like 
i am a switchboard 
he is the circuits 
my hips move with his—rhythmic 
my voice isn’t my own when i moan—it is music 
like fingers on a violin string 
he sparks enough electricity within me to power a city 
when we finish i look right at him 
and tell him 


that was magic 




when i walked into the coffee shop and saw you. my body did not react like 
it had the first time. i waited for my heart to abandon me. for my legs to 
freeze up. to fall to the ground crying at your sight. nothing happened. there 
was no connection or movement inside when we locked eyes. you looked 
like a regular guy with your regular clothes and regular coffee. nothing 
profound about you. i don’t give myself enough credit. my body must have 
cleansed itself of you long ago. must have gotten tired of me behaving like 
i’d lost the best thing to have happened. and wrung the insecurities out 
while i was busy wallowing in pity. that day i had no makeup on. my hair 
was all over the place. i was wearing my brother’s old t-shirt and pajama 
pants. yet i felt like a gleaming siren. a mermaid. i did a little dance in the 
car while driving home. even though we were both under the same roof of 
that coffee shop. i was still solar systems away from you.

why am i always running in circles 
between wanting you to want me 
and when you want me 
deciding it is too emotionally naked 
for me to live with 
why do i make loving me so difficult 
as if you should never have to witness 
the ghosts i have tucked under my breast 
i used to be more open 
when it came to matters like this my love 


-if only we’d met when i was that willing 

i could not contain myself any longer 
i ran to the ocean 
in the middle of the night 
and confessed my love for you to the water 
as i finished telling her 
the salt in her body became sugar 



(ode to sobha singh’s sohni mahiwal) 



i say maybe this is a mistake. maybe we need more than love to make this 
work. 


you place your lips on mine. when our faces are buzzing with the ecstasy of 
kissing you say tell me that isn’t right. and as much as i’d like to think with 
my head. my racing heart is all that makes sense. there. right there is the 
answer you’re looking for. in my loss of breath. my lack of words. my 
silence. my inability to speak means you’ve filled my stomach with so 
many butterflies that even if this is a mistake. it could only be right to be 
this wrong with you.

if i’m going to share my life with a partner 
it would be foolish not to ask myself 
twenty years from now 
is this person going to be 
someone i still laugh with 
or am i just distracted by their charm 
do i see us evolving into 
new people by the decade 
or does the growing ever come to a pause 
i don’t want to be distracted 
by the looks or the money 
i want to know if they pull 
the best or the worst out of me 
deep at the core are our values the same 
in thirty years will we still 
jump into bed like we’re twenty 
can i picture us in old age 
conquering the world 
like we’ve got young blood 
running in our veins

what is it with you and sunflowers he asks 


i point to the field of yellow outside

it’s what you do to me

i stop myself from 
saying the words out loud

might wear them down

the most important conversations 
we’ll have are with our fingers 
when yours nervously graze mine 
for the first time during dinner 
they’ll tighten with fear 
when you ask to see me again next week 
but as soon as i say yes 
they’ll stretch out in ease 
when they grasp one another 
while we’re beneath the sheets 
the two of us will pretend 
we’re not weak in the knees 
when i get angry 
they’ll pulse with bitter cries 
but when they tremble for forgiveness 
you’ll see what apologies look like 
and when one of us is dying 
on a hospital bed at eighty-five 
your fingers will grip mine 
to say things words can’t describe

so much empty space wanting to be consumed 
but no intimacy around to consume it 
it feels like being stuck at a train station 
waiting and waiting and waiting 
for the one with your name on it

but the sun still burns shamelessly on yours 
i crumble knowing even our skies are different 
we have been together so long

it has been one of the greatest and most difficult years of my life. i learned 
everything is temporary. moments. feelings. people. flowers. i learned love 
is about giving. everything. and letting it hurt. i learned vulnerability is 
always the right choice because it is easy to be cold in a world that makes it 
so very difficult to remain soft. i learned all things come in twos. life and 
death. pain and joy. salt and sugar. me and you. it is the balance of the 
universe. it has been the year of hurting so bad but living so good. making 
friends out of strangers. making strangers out of friends. learning mint 
chocolate chip ice cream will fix just about everything. and for the pains it 
can’t there will always be my mother’s arms. we must learn to focus on 
warm energy. always. soak our limbs in it and become better lovers to the 
world. for if we can’t learn to be kind to each other how will we ever learn 
to be kind to the most desperate parts of ourselves.

that my mother and her mother and her mother did not have the privilege of 
feeling. what an honor. to be the first woman in the family who gets to taste 
her desires. no wonder i am starving to fill up on this life. i have generations 
of bellies to eat for. the grandmothers must be howling with laughter. 
huddled around a mud stove in the afterlife. sipping on steaming glasses of

like a bride at the aisle 
send me off in my brightest clothing 
serve ice cream with rose petals to our guests 
there’s no reason to cry my dear 
i have waited my whole life 
for such a beauty to take 
my breath away 
when i go 
let it be a celebration 
for i have been here 
i have lived 
i have won at this game called life 


-funeral 

it was when i stopped searching for home within others 
and lifted the foundations of home within myself 
i found there were no roots more intimate 
than those between a mind and body 
that have decided to be whole 




what good am i 
if i do not fill the plates 
of the ones who fed me 
but fill the plates of strangers 


-family 

even if they’ve been separated 
they’ll end up together 
you can’t keep lovers apart 
no matter how much 
i pluck and pull them 
my eyebrows always 
find their way 
back to each other 


-unibrow 

a child and an elder sat across from each other at a table 
a cup of milk and tea before them 
the elder asked the child 
if she was enjoying her life 
the child answered yes 
life was good but 
she couldn’t wait to grow up 
and do grown-up things 
then the child asked the elder the same question 
he too said life was good 
but he’d give anything to go back to an age 
where moving and dreaming were still possibilities 
they both took a sip from their cups 
but the child’s milk had curdled 
the elder’s tea had grown bitter 
there were tears running from their eyes 



the day you have everything 
i hope you remember 
when you had nothing 




she is not a porn category 
or the type you look for 
on a friday night 
she is not needy or easy or weak 


-daddy issues is not a punch line 

i long to be a lily pad 




i made change after change 
on the road to perfection 
but when i finally felt beautiful enough 
their definition of beauty 
suddenly changed 


what if there is no finish line 
and in an attempt to keep up 
i lose the gifts i was born with 
for a beauty so insecure 
it can’t commit to itself 


-the lies they sell 

you want to keep 
the blood and the milk hidden 
as if the womb and breast 
never fed you 




it is a trillion-dollar industry that would collapse 
if we believed we were beautiful enough already 




their concept of beauty 
is manufactured 
i am not 


-human 

how do i shake this envy 
when i see you doing well 
sister how do i love myself enough to know 
your accomplishments are not my failures 


-we are not each other’s competition 

it is a blessing 
to be the color of earth 
do you know how often 
flowers confuse me for home 




we need more love 
not from men 
but from ourselves 
and each other 


-medicine 

you are a mirror 
if you continue to starve yourself of love 
you’ll only meet people who’ll starve you too 
if you soak yourself in love 
the universe will hand you those 
who’ll love you too 


-a simple math 

how much 
or how little 
clothing she has on 
has nothing to do with how free she is 


-covered | uncovered 

there are mountains growing 
beneath our feet 
that cannot be contained 
all we’ve endured 
has prepared us for this 
bring your hammers and fists 
we have a glass ceiling to shatter 


-let’s leave this place roofless 

it isn’t blood that makes you my sister 
it’s how you understand my heart 
as though you carry it 
in your body 



what is the greatest lesson a woman should learn 


that since day one 
she’s already had everything she needs within herself 
it’s the world that convinced her she did not 




they convinced me 
i only had a few good years left 
before i was replaced by a girl younger than me 
as though men yield power with age 
but women grow into irrelevance 
they can keep their lies 
for i have just gotten started 
i feel as though i just left the womb 
my twenties are the warm-up 
for what i’m really about to do 
wait till you see me in my thirties 
now that will be a proper introduction 
to the nasty. wild. woman in me. 
how can i leave before the party’s started 
rehearsals begin at forty 
i ripen with age 
i do not come with an expiration date 
and now 
for the main event 
curtains up at fifty 
let’s begin the show 


-timeless 

to heal 
you have to 
get to the root 
of the wound 
and kiss it all the way up 




they threw us in a pit to end each other 
so they wouldn’t have to 
starved us of space so long 
we had to eat each other up to stay alive 
look up look up look up 
to catch them looking down at us 
how can we compete with each other 
when the real monster is too big 
to take down alone 



when my daughter is living in my belly 
i will speak to her like 
she’s already changed the world 
she will walk out of me on a red carpet 
fully equipped with the knowledge 
that she’s capable of 
anything she sets her mind to 



(ode to raymond douillet’s a short tour and farewell) 



now 
is not the time 
to be quiet 
or make room for you 
when we have had no room at all 
now 
is our time 
to be mouthy 
get as loud as we need 
to be heard 




representation 
is vital 
otherwise the butterfly 
surrounded by a group of moths 
unable to see itself 
will keep trying to become the moth 


-representation 

take the compliment 
do not shy away from 
another thing that belongs to you 



our work should equip 
the next generation of women 
to outdo us in every field 
this is the legacy we’ll leave behind 


-progress 

the road to changing the world 
is never-ending 


-pace yourself 

the necessity to protect you overcame me 
i love you too much 
to remain quiet as you weep 
watch me rise to kiss the poison out of you 
i will resist the temptation 
of my tired feet 
and keep marching 
with tomorrow in one hand 
and a fist in the other 
i will carry you to freedom 


-love letter to the world 

have your eyes ever fallen upon a beast like me 
i have the spine of a mulberry tree 
the neck of a sunflower 
sometimes i am the desert 
at times the rain forest 
but always the wild 
my belly brims over the waistband of my pants 
each strand of hair frizzing out like a lifeline 
it took a long time to become 
such a sweet rebellion 
back then i refused to water my roots 
till i realized 
if i am the only one 
who can be the wilderness 
then let me be the wilderness 
the tree trunk cannot become the branch 
the jungle cannot become the garden 
so why should i 


-it is so full here in myself 

many try 
but cannot tell the difference 
between a marigold and my skin 
both of them are an orange sun 
blinding the ones who have not learned to love the light 




if you have never 
stood with the oppressed 
there is still time 


-lift them 

the year is done. i spread the past three hundred 
sixty-five days before me on the living room carpet. 


here is the month i decided to shed everything not deeply committed to my 
dreams. the day i refused to be a victim to the self-pity. here is the week i 
slept in the garden. the spring i wrung the self-doubt by its neck. hung your 
kindness up. took down the calendar. the week i danced so hard my heart 
learned to float above water again. the summer i unscrewed all the mirrors 
from their walls. no longer needed to see myself to feel seen. combed the 
weight out of my hair. 


i fold the good days up and place them in my back pocket for safekeeping. 
draw the match. cremate the unnecessary. the light of the fire warms my 
toes. i pour myself a glass of warm water to cleanse myself for january. here 
i go. stronger and wiser into the new. 




there is 
nothing left 
to worry about 
the sun and her flowers are here. 




and then there are days when the simple act of breathing 
leaves you exhausted. it seems easier to give up on this life. 
the thought of disappearing brings you peace. for so long i 
was lost in a place where there was no sun. where there 
grew no flowers. but every once in a while out of the 
darkness something i loved would emerge and bring me to 
life again. witnessing a starry sky. the lightness of laughing 
with old friends. a reader who told me the poems had saved 
their life. yet there i was struggling to save my own. my 
darlings. living is difficult. it is difficult for everybody. and 
it is at that moment when living feels like crawling through 
a pin-sized hole. that we must resist the urge of succumbing 
to bad memories. refuse to bow before bad months or bad 
years. cause our eyes are starving to feast on this world. 
there are so many turquoise bodies of water left for us to 
dive in. there is family. blood or chosen. the possibility of 
falling in love. with people and places. hills high as the 
moon. valleys that roll into new worlds. and road trips. i 
find it deeply important to accept that we are not the 
masters of this place. we are her visitors. and like guests 
let’s enjoy this place like a garden. let us treat it with a 
gentle hand. so the ones after us can experience it too. let’s 
find our own sun. grow our own flowers. the universe 
delivered us with the light and the seeds. we might not hear 
it at times but the music is always on. it just needs to be 
turned louder. for as long as there is breath in our lungs— 
we must keep dancing.
